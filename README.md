# customer_segmentation_Kmeans

Final project of the programming part of the exam "Programming and Database" part of the Data Science Degree at UniVR.

The python file “project_fl_marketing.py” can be run with streamlit.

There’s also the Jupyter Notebook on which I’ve spent the most of the time developing the project.
