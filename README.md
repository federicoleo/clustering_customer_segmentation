# programming_project_2022

The python file “project_fl_marketing.py” can be run with streamlit.

There’s also the Jupyter Notebook on which I’ve spent the most of the time developing the project. 

I had problems creating the GitHub commits so it was not possible for me to track everything from the beginning.

Although, the streamlit part on the Python file is full tracked.

The figures are graphs which are needed for the streamlit presentation.
